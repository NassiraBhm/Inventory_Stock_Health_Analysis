# Inventory Stock Health Analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth inventory health analysis using a product dataset to identify understocking and overstocking issues and make concrete recommendations for better supply management. 

âœ… Key Steps:
Initial data cleaning and exploration

Filtering active products to focus on those on sale

Creation of new key variables: inventory gap, inventory status, and gap ratio

Analysis of understocked products:

By category and supplier

Identification of products in critical shortage (low gap ratio)

Analysis of overstocked products:

Segmentation by demand (sales volume)

Identification of high-priced, low-demand products (critical overstock)

Implementation of an ABC analysis to distinguish products with high strategic value

Creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard:

Global KPIs (number of products, % understock, % critical overstock, etc.)

Clear visualizations to support decisions

ðŸ“Œ Key findings:
The majority of understocked products are moderately understocked, with few critical cases

Overstocking is more of a concern for products with Low turnover or high-priced

No strong correlation between inventory status and categories or suppliers

Need for targeted adjustment of reorder levels for certain high-value products
